  abstract = {Accurate predictions on sudden changes in network states are crucial for the integrity of real-time applications. Traditional heuristic models fall short, especially in tail cases, struggling to capture long-term network dependencies. Modelling network traces as time series sequences, we explore the use of a Transformer model architecture, known for its success in time series prediction, to model network trace dependencies, focusing on sudden change predictions. Our preliminary result on using a Transformer model for predicting one-way delay (OWD) shows observable improvement over the heuristic baseline in prediction loss. This suggests a promising direction for enhancing network predictability and optimizing resource utilization.},
